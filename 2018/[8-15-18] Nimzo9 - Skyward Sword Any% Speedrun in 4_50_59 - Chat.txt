[3:39:29] zackiechan03: dank dood
[3:44:22] Xelna: how much fastr is it to exit through that door?
[3:45:48] Emeralds77: few secs
[3:45:48] Nimzo9: iirc it was just a second
[3:49:22] Nimzo9: not a good fight
[3:54:09] kiYubEE: I have a question demStare Do you ever have to worry about your arrow count at all in the run? demThink
[3:54:35] kiYubEE: Or is arrow usage pretty lenient?
[3:56:48] Floha258: I usually don't
[3:57:04] Floha258: Where you have to worry maybe is in Skykeep
[3:57:37] Floha258: But if you know where the arrow drops are you don't have to worry
[4:00:11] Hakua: Squid1 Squid2 TehePelo Squid4
[4:00:16] Nimzo9: yeah, the only place to worry is sky keep, you can skip the arrow drop in the lmf room is you have enough arrows, but it only saves 2seconds
[4:00:39] kiYubEE: 📝 demStare Interesting
[4:04:46] ArcadiaSkies: gud enuff fight :)

[4:27:08] HalfJaise: It skips talking to the old mogma before the door.
[4:27:09] Floha258: With a key
[4:27:12] zackiechan03: he opened it, I'm sure.
[4:27:31] RolfAnakin: did not see any key!
[4:27:38] TheMADMAN731: @Oscar_exe Nimzo's good at this game. Not as good as LMF is with wasting my time
[4:27:40] Emeralds77: look closer next time
[4:27:41] RolfAnakin: I understand keyboy is upset
[4:27:45] Oscar_exe: LUL

[4:28:25] TheMADMAN731: The mogma gives you the key?
[4:28:51] Floha258: No the key is in the chest on the balcony
[4:29:23] HalfJaise: I can't watch the rest nimz, goodluck on this run.

[4:38:45] TheMADMAN731: "Next time, I'll make the pain so excruciating, i'll make your ears bleed from the sound of your own screams!" -Ghirahim, LMF
[4:39:31] Nimzo9: 4:50
[4:42:41] Oscar_exe: I thought it was 4:51, when did you lower it again?
[4:43:07] Emeralds77: when he got a run that was on pace for it i assume
[4:44:55] TheMADMAN731: Demise is The Imprisoned, but in the past?
[4:45:44] Floha258: Demis was banned by the goddess being the improsend
[4:46:12] Floha258: After Link collected the Triforce the Imporsned/Demise was dead in the present
[4:46:25] Floha258: But Ghirahim resurrected him in the past
[4:47:05] TheMADMAN731: Sometimes this game's lore makes less sense than Cuphead.
[4:47:31] Floha258: If you think about it, it makes much sense
[4:48:16] TheMADMAN731: i'll be back in like ten mins nimzo
[4:49:46] Nimzo9: alright
