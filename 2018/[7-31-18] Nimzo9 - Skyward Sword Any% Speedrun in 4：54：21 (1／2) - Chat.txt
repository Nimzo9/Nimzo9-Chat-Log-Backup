[0:28:27] Tladsys: Hi nimzo :)
[0:28:35] IcyNertia: :o
[0:29:37] Nimzo9: hey tlad
[0:29:51] IcyNertia: is this your best pace up to this point
[0:31:20] Hakua: cube warp
[0:32:00] Nimzo9: yeah, I've never had a 26:06 slingshot or lower before
[0:32:09] Emeralds77: PogChamp
[0:32:59] IcyNertia: thats sick, how much does not doing the final blow trick lose
[0:34:03] Emeralds77: what final blow
[0:34:11] IcyNertia: extended blow
[0:34:33] Emeralds77: 40 secs
[0:34:50] Emeralds77: or more idk you skip some fi text later
[0:34:50] IcyNertia: why doesnt he always attempt it then
[0:35:02] Emeralds77: because its rng dependent
[0:35:14] IcyNertia: yes but he still gets it a decent amount of the times
[0:35:23] IcyNertia: and you dont lose that much by failing it
[0:36:09] Hakua: lol what 40
[0:36:27] Emeralds77: idk ask him
[0:37:20] Nimzo9: I've never really practice extending blow lol.
[0:40:05] Hakua: looks like it's 31s
[0:40:09] Hakua: more than I thought
