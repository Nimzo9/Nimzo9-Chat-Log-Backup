[0:43:48] Zuurpruim: Good players should get recognition. Just wondering; why do you use chat to reply in stead of microphone?
[0:46:40] Nimzo9: it's more convenient for me, because of the environment I'm in.
[0:48:59] Zuurpruim: Ok, the gameplay speaks for itself anyway. My first playthrough i didn't like the game that much, but found it was quite nice second time around!
[0:52:02] Zuurpruim: How can i sub? Can't find button...
