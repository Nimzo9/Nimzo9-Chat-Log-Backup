[3:15:26] Nimzo9: I'll be losing time because I died in the beginning

[3:28:59] Emeralds77: jumping in the water wasnt on purpose was it?
[3:29:13] Oscar_exe: no lol
[3:30:44] HalfJaise: Goodluck nimz
[3:32:11] Nimzo9: you can get on to the island with the tear before the water spreads out but i messed it up anyway.

[4:03:26] Oscar_exe: yeah, and 5 golds in 6 splits
[4:03:37] Oscar_exe: your ancient cistern part was really solid
[4:05:08] Nimzo9: thought I had harp cancel down, but it seems I need more practice
[4:06:05] Oscar_exe: you'll get it next two times
[4:07:28] Oscar_exe: na aim Kappa

[4:12:05] Nimzo9: hey daniel
[4:14:32] Oscar_exe: what happens if you try to bomb him?
[4:15:00] Nimzo9: i don't think bombs affect him
[4:15:50] Oscar_exe: I thought he might run away or something
[4:34:44] Daniel200156: why no mic btw? if i may ask
[4:36:42] Nimzo9: I tend to talk to my family a lot during my streams, so I just like to have it off, it's a little inconvenient to keep turning it on and off
[4:38:23] Daniel200156: yeah i get thta
[4:41:18] Nimzo9: I do have time save on fireshield earings.
[4:41:30] Nimzo9: haven't gotten a best with harp cancel with it yet
[4:41:39] Harmjan387: Nice golds sofar man
[4:42:46] Harmjan387: how hard is harp cancel?
[4:43:07] HalfJaise: Harp Cancel isn't really hard. Just semi-precise timing.
[4:43:24] Harmjan387: alright
[4:43:44] Daniel200156: according to gymnast its about a 5 frame window, looks more like a 5-10 frame window though
[4:51:49] Emeralds77: good

[5:14:23] Emeralds77: doesnt look that impossible to me
[5:14:38] Oscar_exe: decent RNG
[5:14:46] Oscar_exe: it's not impossible
[5:14:54] Oscar_exe: but it would be the god run
[5:15:13] Oscar_exe: I don't see it ever happening without extending blow
[5:15:28] Oscar_exe: losing time dang
[5:15:38] Oscar_exe: I guess this split really wasn't good
