[0:38:38] Nimzo9: idk
[0:39:57] Nimzo9: I would have saved more time if that didn't happen >(
[0:40:12] Emeralds77: zfgMad
[0:42:30] Extodasher: Yeah, that's a pretty dumb timeloss
[0:48:24] Emeralds77: zfgGoldOgre

[1:07:08] Nimzo9: yes, sorry.
[1:07:18] greatwhitegirth: thats all you need
[1:09:50] Nimzo9: some people are turned off by no mic or cam.
[1:11:36] C_MidKnight: honestly I use streams as background noise while I work, so no audio is fine :)
[1:11:45] C_MidKnight: err... just game audio
[1:16:47] JazzMuzak: When you speedrun this game does listening to Fi ever make you want to kill yourself?
[1:18:20] HalfJaise: I believe the official pronunciation is Phai
[1:18:47] HalfJaise: Actually now i'm not sure Kappa
[1:19:31] HalfJaise: nice cycle
[1:19:34] HalfJaise: This will be a good split

[1:59:04] Hakua: Squid1 Squid2 Squid3 Squid4
[1:59:15] Emeralds77: zfgRunOgre
[2:08:42] BlueHarvey: you were almost 2 mins ahead at one pint
[2:08:44] BlueHarvey: what the
[2:09:08] BlueHarvey: so does this mean sub 4:52 is doable ?
[2:09:23] Emeralds77: barely
[2:09:34] Emeralds77: not realistically
[2:09:34] BlueHarvey: thats a godly pace
[2:09:50] C_MidKnight: >(
[2:09:58] BlueHarvey: wow thats punishing
[2:10:11] C_MidKnight: everything in this game is punishing
[2:10:23] Porates: Auch entspannt wenn keiner reded ;D
[2:10:27] HalfJaise: I mean if earlier he was low 4:52 pace. And he still another 30 seconds with Mogma CS Skip and Skyloft trial.
[2:10:47] BlueHarvey: dont speak german in here
[2:11:00] Emeralds77: deutsch O.o
[2:11:14] Zelkys: sup nimzo, how are you? good luck witht he run :)
[2:11:29] Porates: doesnt know which language
[2:11:30] BlueHarvey: it also looks like skyward sowrd is the big new hot thing
[2:11:35] Porates: so i tried german :D
[2:11:54] BlueHarvey: everyone is runing SS
[2:12:08] Emeralds77: not really
[2:12:12] BlueHarvey: also skipping those cutscenes
[2:12:17] BlueHarvey: with putting the harp away
[2:12:25] BlueHarvey: can that be done everytime ?
[2:12:29] BlueHarvey: on every sigil ?
[2:12:39] Emeralds77: at the trail gates only
[2:12:44] Emeralds77: as of now
[2:12:48] Emeralds77: *trial
[2:12:52] Porates: How long takes to 100% run?
[2:13:00] HalfJaise: Porates 7 1/2 hrs to 8 hrs
[2:13:07] Emeralds77: 7 hours 30
[2:13:11] HalfJaise: For a good runner.
[2:13:13] Porates: not much more
[2:13:14] HalfJaise: is around that time
[2:13:26] BlueHarvey: tbh tho
[2:13:30] BlueHarvey: SS only had good runners
[2:13:34] BlueHarvey: has*
[2:13:53] HalfJaise: Except me FeelsBadMan
[2:14:03] Emeralds77: youll get there
[2:14:41] BlueHarvey: SS is not an easy game by any means

[2:14:56] BlueHarvey: nimzos PB is wr
[2:15:11] Frisbee1029: okey goodbye

[2:20:44] HalfJaise: wow
[2:20:48] BlueHarvey: ?
[2:20:53] BlueHarvey: is that rip run ?
[2:20:57] HalfJaise: no
[2:21:02] HalfJaise: But thats time loss
[2:21:03] C_MidKnight: he went too far ahead
[2:23:09] Emeralds77: nice
[2:26:44] LynxAwakening_: Hey, gl on the run :)
[2:27:50] Nimzo9: ty lynx :)

[2:35:22] C_MidKnight: *timesave
[2:35:39] Emeralds77: tfw bad run but 1min ahead
[2:52:00] Nimzo9: what
[2:52:10] C_MidKnight: oh

[3:07:00] Nimzo9: thanks oscar
[3:07:25] Oscar_exe: did you get the new cutscene skip in FS.
[3:07:27] Oscar_exe: ?*
[3:08:42] Nimzo9: yeah, but I only saved like 7s on that segment because I failed escort once.
[3:09:05] Oscar_exe: dang
[3:10:13] Nimzo9: Biggest timeloss what around sandship to fireshield earings, lost over a minute there.
[3:10:23] Nimzo9: *was around
[3:11:55] Oscar_exe: you might be capable to get a 4:52 that is insane lol
[3:16:51] Nimzo9: Yeah, 4:52's my goal for now.
[3:16:58] Nimzo9: gonna lose time here.
