[0:00:24] Simikins: Also because you're opting to do the backup EB now
[0:00:29] Simikins: which makes sense
[0:06:34] Hayarin_: BOkoblin RNG, they're in this together
[0:07:00] Hayarin_: so bad, that I'm going away again
[0:12:16] Simikins: At least the start can be somewhat consistent up to EB
[0:13:03] Nimzo9: yeah, but it's honestly just a bore to just play for 25 minutes then reset
[0:13:40] OlliFerris_PartTimeFerret: Better than hatching 150 eggs in a day.
[0:13:44] OlliFerris_PartTimeFerret: Oh boy!
[0:14:51] Simikins: I believe it
[0:15:08] OlliFerris_PartTimeFerret: I have about five more eggs before I'm done for the day.
[0:16:35] OlliFerris_PartTimeFerret: I'll be able to tell you all when I started in a second.
[0:17:29] Hayarin_: which shiny you're trying to get?
[0:17:35] OlliFerris_PartTimeFerret: HA Scorbunny.
[0:18:02] OlliFerris_PartTimeFerret: I have a shiny regular Scorbunny and a shiny Cinderace as well.
[0:19:15] OlliFerris_PartTimeFerret: Oh, I thought the game told me the time I got the egg.
[0:19:20] OlliFerris_PartTimeFerret: F, it doesn't.
[0:19:32] OlliFerris_PartTimeFerret: I know I was here about an hour before the first time Nimzo was streaming today.
[0:19:55] OlliFerris_PartTimeFerret: I'll go five more eggs for good measure.
[0:20:49] Simikins: clockwise nunchuck spin pog
[0:23:36] Nimzo9: I think I told you before simi that clockwise is easier for me on nunchuk
[0:24:14] Simikins: ye that's why I pointed it out lol
[0:24:28] Simikins: i find it interesting that your preference is reversed between controllers
[0:24:54] shyAce2: yo gl gl\
[0:25:20] OlliFerris_PartTimeFerret: 1025 eggs hatched.
[0:25:22] Nimzo9: ty simi
[0:25:23] OlliFerris_PartTimeFerret: NICE!
[0:25:29] shyAce2: PogChamp
[0:25:33] Hayarin_: PogChamp
[0:25:37] Nimzo9: i mean ace lol
[0:25:39] Simikins: nice
[0:25:43] Simikins: hey asxce
[0:25:49] shyAce2: hey Simi
[0:28:03] Simikins: whip aim
[0:28:21] Simikins: not whip aim
[0:29:17] Simikins: 28 beetle Pog
[0:32:11] Nimzo9: Hopefully I'm not using up too many seeds
[0:35:49] OlliFerris_PartTimeFerret: Back.
[0:36:52] OlliFerris_PartTimeFerret: I'm so disappointed, to be honest.
[0:36:57] OlliFerris_PartTimeFerret: But I'll get better.
[0:37:03] OlliFerris_PartTimeFerret: I thought for sure today'd be the day.
[0:37:45] Nimzo9: better luck next time I guess
[0:38:46] ZachLink99: that beedle time is nuts
[0:38:48] ZachLink99: beetle
[0:38:53] ZachLink99: gluck :)
[0:40:21] OlliFerris_PartTimeFerret: Good luck.
[0:41:06] Nimzo9: ty
[0:41:34] OlliFerris_PartTimeFerret: Yo!
[0:42:35] ZachLink99: rip bonks
[0:43:42] A1gamer2003: PogChamp
[0:45:42] ZachLink99: that bomb thing never works for me lol
[0:45:50] ZachLink99: i always either die or it doesnt hit the rocks
[0:47:27] Simikins: What was that ending blow cancel thing, did you ledge cancel it or something? Was scared because looked like you could fall in the lava but then you just hopped away
[0:47:54] ZachLink99: u can actually fall in the lava from an ending blow its happened to me
[0:47:59] ZachLink99: ye i thought i saw that too
[0:48:03] ZachLink99: wasnt sure if i was just dumb or something tho
[0:49:02] Simikins: https://clips.twitch.tv/TardyGentleTroutPlanking looked cool
[0:49:08] Nimzo9: that's why I went to the side
[0:49:15] Nimzo9: because I knew I was gonna ledge cancel
[0:49:27] Nimzo9: if I ending blowed directly I would have hopped into the lava
[0:49:59] Simikins: Ah that's cool, I didn't know ledge cancels were a thing, I've just seen people fall into the lava from EB before
[0:50:02] Hayarin_: is it just me or is the stream really low frame rate?
[0:50:16] Dranny_: Yeah obs is epic
[0:51:23] Nimzo9: sorry
[0:51:28] Nimzo9: internet being dumb
[0:51:41] Hayarin_: oh, it's all good again
[0:51:42] Nimzo9: Hopefully it fixes itself
[0:52:05] Simikins: good scaldera :o
[0:54:31] gymnast86: shoutouts to the invisible tablet
[0:54:45] babyporkchops1: wow
[0:54:48] babyporkchops1: gl kid
[0:54:52] ZachLink99: F for the amber tablet
[0:55:10] Simikins: it's there again Pog

[0:59:52] gymnast86: nice
[0:59:59] Hayarin_: wow
[0:59:59] ZachLink99: gym you spoiled me :(
[1:00:07] Simikins: same zach lol
[1:00:08] Simikins: ok run
[1:00:13] gymnast86: oh rip
[1:00:31] Dranny_: How tf is sub 1:30 almost here
[1:00:36] gymnast86: woah, nice wrong warp Kappa
[1:00:49] ZachLink99: because the route has only been a week old
[1:00:53] babyporkchops1: gyms sweating
[1:01:11] ZachLink99: rip
[1:01:16] Dranny_: This wall better not be slippery
[1:01:36] ZachLink99: NotLikeThis runs dead because of losing stamina
[1:02:18] Simikins: You're local recording right Nimzo? These frames :p
[1:02:33] ZachLink99: monkaS
[1:02:52] ZachLink99: stupid twitch
[1:03:16] ZachLink99: or net or whatever
[1:03:22] ZachLink99: i just blame twitch Kappa
[1:03:37] Nimzo9: yeah I am
[1:03:45] Nimzo9: also I think I'm gonna lose time here?
[1:03:50] Nimzo9: depends on if I get first try hop
[1:03:52] ZachLink99: nimzo d you have yt
[1:03:59] ZachLink99: or do you upload local records to twitch
[1:05:04] Simikins: too fancy
[1:05:44] ZachLink99: i hate this without goddess sword
[1:06:11] Nimzo9: yeah I'm losing time
[1:07:31] Dranny_: Bitch ass wall
[1:07:53] Dranny_: jk you were nice
[1:07:56] ZachLink99: nice
[1:07:57] babyporkchops1: nice
[1:09:58] Simikins: get those cacti
[1:10:27] ZachLink99: could you maybe activate the minecart with a skyward stab right before saving
[1:10:38] ZachLink99: just so you can take a more direct path to the thunder dragon
[1:10:42] ZachLink99: idk if it would reach
[1:11:27] Nimzo9: I basically lost 30s that segment
[1:11:33] Nimzo9: not sure
[1:11:58] ZachLink99: Overall the big timesaves are that and a little in earth
[1:12:07] ZachLink99: and maybe some more on harp, not too sure tho
[1:12:55] ZachLink99: may the harp goddess's take over this run during this segment
[1:14:01] Deesh23: PogChamp
[1:14:03] ZachLink99: GG
[1:14:05] babyporkchops1: gg
[1:14:09] Deesh23: GL on the run Nimzo :D Lookin' hot PogChamp
[1:14:17] Deesh23: 59:10 Harp Kreygasm
[1:14:43] ZachLink99: is harp WR a 58
[1:14:53] Deesh23: I think this is Harp WR
[1:15:01] ZachLink99: Tbh i think i heard you can skip bombs if you wanted to do harp runs
[1:15:11] Deesh23: Indy already has done that
[1:15:12] Nimzo9: ty desg
[1:15:21] ZachLink99: but harp is pointless now that any% is like 30 min longer
[1:15:22] Deesh23: Indy did an itemless harp run
[1:15:30] Deesh23: Yeah Harp is kinda dead LUL
[1:15:36] Deesh23: MSRTA is where it's at Kreygasm
[1:15:36] Simikins: yeah no-one cares about the actual harp category rn, this is the best Harp time I've sen
[1:15:38] ZachLink99: MAKE SURE TO NOT BIT
[1:15:41] Dranny_: Feet
[1:15:45] Nimzo9: *deesh
[1:15:55] ZachLink99: MS rta? isnt that just any% also lol
[1:16:01] Deesh23: no
[1:16:07] ZachLink99: o ok
[1:16:10] Deesh23: It used to be very close to it
[1:16:15] Deesh23: But it'd be much different now
[1:16:23] Deesh23: It's MS, not TMS, TMS don't count
[1:16:33] ZachLink99: o
[1:16:45] ZachLink99: idk the story or anything about ss i just know how to follow the route LUL
[1:17:02] Deesh23: It's like in WW/HD where you can do EMS, and have the full Master Sword (I think), but the MSRTA category is just the normal MS
[1:17:27] Deesh23: and where you're supposed to get it*
[1:17:36] ZachLink99: where do you even get MS
[1:17:41] ZachLink99: is it fire santuary
[1:17:43] Deesh23: yeah
[1:17:50] ZachLink99: ah
[1:18:05] ZachLink99: i actually liked post fire sanctuary in the old route
[1:18:29] ZachLink99: optimizations for boko base, tadtones, minecart escort looked fun
[1:18:44] Deesh23: Minecart Escort wasn't LUL
[1:18:48] Deesh23: Boko Base and Tadtones tho
[1:18:52] Deesh23: Kreygasm Kreygasm Kreygasm
[1:19:08] ZachLink99: idk i thought minecart escort looked cool
[1:19:15] ZachLink99: maybe if you do it like 1000 times i can see why its bad tho
[1:19:26] Deesh23: It's an auto scroller
[1:19:26] ZachLink99: 100% in this game is where the shits at tho lol
[1:19:32] Deesh23: ^^^^^^
[1:19:40] Deesh23: Speaking of, Nimzo
[1:19:49] Deesh23: I seem to recall you saying to me something about doing Hundo in 2020...
[1:19:50] Deesh23: Kappa
[1:19:52] ZachLink99: yeah i guess its an autoscroller but it looked like it had some optimizations
[1:20:06] Deesh23: Yeah it had some clever optimizations which were p cool
[1:21:39] HalfJaise: spicy speedrun
[1:21:53] HalfJaise: will you keep doing any% after this run finishes?
[1:22:20] Simikins: gotta let it finish first :p
[1:22:27] ZachLink99: ^
[1:22:39] HalfJaise: I can see the future, its a 1:30:28.56
[1:23:05] Hayarin_: now i'm scared
[1:23:21] Nimzo9: I don't have any expectations for this run
[1:23:27] Nimzo9: it'll probably die to horde skip somehow
[1:23:27] Dranny_: If sheild boi isnt nice I'm screaming
[1:23:39] Deesh23: Jaise tryna put on the pressure 'cause he's sweatin' af Kappa
[1:24:05] HalfJaise: LUL nah man someone needs to beat my run
[1:24:07] HalfJaise: it sucks
[1:24:22] HalfJaise: I just did attempts for like 2 hours and most of them died to eb
[1:24:23] HalfJaise: it gets draining
[1:24:25] Dranny_: Wait did this run get eb
[1:24:34] gymnast86: yep
[1:24:34] Deesh23: yes
[1:24:37] Hayarin_: it did
[1:25:29] Deesh23: Remember when there was an hour left in the run after this CS? OMEGALUL
[1:26:43] Deesh23: PogChamp
[1:26:43] Dranny_: Nice
[1:26:48] Hayarin_: good
[1:27:22] babyporkchops1: im sweating
[1:27:30] Deesh23: Nice arrow CS skip LUL
[1:27:30] HalfJaise: arrow skip PogChamp
[1:27:34] Simikins: Pog
[1:27:56] ZachLink99: whats the timer at for u guys
[1:28:02] Simikins: 1:27:43
[1:28:08] ZachLink99: ok im actually ahead of simi
[1:28:11] ZachLink99: but im behind other people i think
[1:28:15] Hayarin_: I really really wanna rewatch this run without low frame rate :/
[1:28:25] HalfJaise: 1:28:20 for me
[1:28:29] Deesh23: 1:28:15 for me now
[1:28:35] Nimzo9: really slow segment
[1:28:39] ZachLink99: 1:28:30 now
[1:28:49] ZachLink99: gl on final part :)
[1:29:06] Nimzo9: ty wretched brat
[1:29:14] ZachLink99: D:
[1:29:20] Deesh23: YOU WRETCHED BRAT
[1:29:20] OlliFerris_PartTimeFerret: Yo!
[1:29:21] Simikins: D:
[1:29:24] babyporkchops1: D:
[1:29:32] shyAce2: D:
[1:29:32] Deesh23: F for Zach
[1:29:38] babyporkchops1: nut
[1:29:39] ZachLink99: my feelings are hurting
[1:29:42] OlliFerris_PartTimeFerret: I took a stress nap, sorry.
[1:30:24] Benstephens56: :0
[1:30:38] Laconic_Loner: gg
[1:30:40] babyporkchops1: FrankerZ FrankerZ FrankerZ
[1:30:41] ZachLink99: GG
[1:30:43] BenAtmos: Congrats on the PB!!

[1:30:55] OlliFerris_PartTimeFerret: Gg!
[1:30:56] babyporkchops1: gg
[1:30:56] Nimzo9: Just mad I lost 30s on minecart
[1:31:04] Deesh23: The king is back PogChamp
[1:31:11] Hayarin_: he did it bois
[1:31:14] babyporkchops1: hes done it
[1:31:14] crizzlel: gg
[1:31:17] OlliFerris_PartTimeFerret: Praise be!
[1:31:23] Hayarin_: PridePog
[1:31:29] Simikins: Was prettttty hot until minecart
[1:31:33] ZachLink99: now gotta do the same thing in tp
[1:31:36] ZachLink99: :)
[1:31:38] babyporkchops1: wr in ss and tp
[1:31:45] Nimzo9: I have a local recording backed up so I can upload that for the part of the run where internet just went bad
[1:31:56] Nimzo9: amarec beep for proof
[1:32:00] Simikins: beep boop
[1:32:01] Hayarin_: Please > <
[1:32:05] babyporkchops1: beep
[1:32:12] babyporkchops1: congrats king
[1:32:22] shyAce2: beep beep boop
[1:32:29] Nimzo9: I'm on the edge of wanting to improve this lol
[1:32:37] Nimzo9: and just being fine with it
[1:32:40] Latella_: congrats :)
[1:32:48] OlliFerris_PartTimeFerret: How's it feel?
[1:32:49] Nimzo9: ty yall
[1:32:52] Dranny_: this got eb and cs thats kinda epic
[1:32:54] ZachLink99: sub 1:30 is pretty tight but defo doable
[1:32:58] OlliFerris_PartTimeFerret: You're welcome buddy!
[1:33:18] babyporkchops1: 51 seconds of SOB thats crazy
[1:33:28] ZachLink99: whats hard is not making any mistakes if you do get your full timesave at minecart tho
[1:33:43] AvaKittyGirl: Congrats on WR!
[1:33:45] Nimzo9: This run is basically the same execution wise as my 1:31:30
[1:33:49] Nimzo9: I just saved a min for extending blow
[1:34:35] ZachLink99: gg tho
[1:34:46] Nimzo9: I can def see sub 1:30 with a solid run
[1:34:48] ZachLink99: if you hypothetically didnt work on improving ss any% what you doing next?
[1:34:51] A1gamer2003: Ggs
[1:35:06] Nimzo9: idk, I wouldn't mind trying other ss categories
[1:35:12] ZachLink99: :O
[1:35:14] Dranny_: Hundo incoming
[1:35:17] AvaKittyGirl: Someone could probs get sub 1:30 with decent timesaves
[1:35:24] HalfJaise: AD does need a good run with the new route
[1:35:26] Deesh23: Sub-1:30 is totally happening
[1:35:33] Deesh23: Just depends on who's gonna do it
[1:35:34] ZachLink99: also gotta remember
[1:35:53] Deesh23: AD will go sub-3:15 with the new stuff, very possibly even sub-3:10
[1:35:56] ZachLink99: 1 week old route so there can be more route timesaves
[1:35:59] Dranny_: Sub 130 with current route needs eb but does it need cs
[1:36:06] ZachLink99: hundo sub 6:50 with bed trick?
[1:36:14] Deesh23: Deffo Zach
[1:36:25] Nimzo9: grinding for sub 1:30 doesn't really seem fun though
[1:36:34] Deesh23: Says you Kappa
[1:36:43] HalfJaise: definitely not
[1:36:52] Nimzo9: If I were to continue grinding I'd have to reset over not getting first try eb
[1:36:55] HalfJaise: if eb was like in the first 7 mins of the game like Bo is in TP it'd be great
[1:37:05] Nimzo9: ^
[1:37:20] Nimzo9: backup eb is like 22 sec but it's still kinda iffy
[1:37:24] AvaKittyGirl: Yes definitely
[1:37:35] Dranny_: backup would need cs for sure
[1:37:38] A1gamer2003: I would dig an AD run
[1:38:04] ZachLink99: have you ever ran any other category / game besides tp / ss any%s?
[1:38:07] AvaKittyGirl: I've started practice-running this and yes eb is a pain
[1:38:44] Nimzo9: but like I definitely want to play more ss
[1:38:52] Nimzo9: it's only been 12 days since I've been back
[1:39:04] Nimzo9: AD sounds interesting
[1:39:29] Nimzo9: no zach
[1:39:34] Nimzo9: actually
[1:39:40] Nimzo9: I've ran graveyard parkour OpieOP
[1:40:04] babyporkchops1: 8.9 sec
[1:40:06] babyporkchops1: clean
[1:40:44] ZachLink99: SS is such a good game
[1:41:46] Deesh23: ^^^^^^^^^^^^
[1:41:55] Deesh23: Didn't you do some SMS?
[1:42:02] Deesh23: Like, 2 runs of it? XD
[1:42:09] Nimzo9: yeah lol
[1:42:19] Nimzo9: I needed sms as stress relief
[1:42:40] HalfJaise: TP is the serious show while SMS was comedic relief
[1:42:41] HalfJaise: Kappa
[1:44:13] Nimzo9: So when you gonna beat this time jaise gymKyu
[1:44:24] ZachLink99: wtf is that beeping lol
[1:44:31] Nimzo9: it's the harp
[1:44:38] Nimzo9: You can play the harp during credits
[1:44:40] ZachLink99: What
[1:44:48] ZachLink99: tbh i didnt even know this game has credits lol
[1:44:54] ZachLink99: i just never watched them
[1:45:03] Deesh23: I don't think that's the 'beeping' he was talking about LUL
[1:45:09] HalfJaise: When EB decides to be nice and I don't choke
[1:45:10] HalfJaise: then maybe
[1:45:16] ZachLink99: o i thought the beeping was just my end then
[1:45:22] Nimzo9: I mean I use my desktop audio for streaming
[1:45:32] Nimzo9: so you might hear beeps from my pc
[1:45:47] ZachLink99: yeah thats what it was i guess
[1:45:56] Nimzo9: tbh the greatest find for ss would be consistent EB
[1:46:13] HalfJaise: dude i was working on that the other day for like 2 hours
[1:46:16] HalfJaise: didnt get anything though
[1:46:24] HalfJaise: i thought i did for a moment
[1:46:57] ZachLink99: just run hundo you dont even do eb Kappa
[1:47:12] Nimzo9: Why did a casual have to get EB, and we had to find out >(
[1:47:40] Nimzo9: oh yeah
[1:47:48] Nimzo9: I might also implement lava hop
[1:47:58] Deesh23: monkaS
[1:48:03] ZachLink99: whats that
[1:48:07] Nimzo9: Like I could go for backup eb then lava hop, and I think that'd be around the same as just getting first try eb
[1:48:51] ZachLink99: can some1 link that? im interested
[1:49:02] Nimzo9: If you're on lava during a cs, after the cs ends you have 1 frame to input a move
[1:49:13] ZachLink99: monkaS
[1:49:17] Deesh23: https://www.zeldaspeedruns.com/ss/tech/lava-hop
[1:49:21] HalfJaise: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=79OmD99X-8g
[1:49:30] HalfJaise: thats the video of the specific use of lava hop he's referring to
[1:49:32] Nimzo9: and you can use that to reach a point you're normally not supposed to and change the spawn point of the boulder
[1:49:42] Nimzo9: it's faster than the rbm
[1:51:16] ZachLink99: omg wtf
[1:51:21] ZachLink99: was that known on the old route?
[1:51:25] Deesh23: Yes
[1:51:25] Nimzo9: I dropped 38000 frames
[1:51:27] Nimzo9: yeah
[1:51:30] HalfJaise: it's been known for an extremely long time
[1:51:31] Deesh23: Been known for a long time
[1:51:34] Deesh23: nice Nimz
[1:51:36] Nimzo9: it saved a minute and a half in old 5 hour run
[1:51:37] ZachLink99: lmfao you must've been dying to do that trick on the old route right?
