[1:24:16] polarsunsolarpun: Retried this game after a break and I'm almost done after 30 hours xD
[1:24:42] Nimzo9: Thanks John, that means a lot.
[1:28:21] polarsunsolarpun: Is this regular or hero mode?
[1:28:49] Nimzo9: hero.
[1:30:19] Nimzo9: Hero mode allows us to skip certain cutscenese, and gives us an upgrade skyward strike.
[1:31:00] polarsunsolarpun: Ohhhh that's why you have the long skyward strikes
