[0:38:12] romulostx: gl
[0:40:31] Nimzo9: Thanks.
[0:43:36] Nimzo9: Died at Skyview.
[1:11:17] Nimzo9: Good minecart trick.
[1:12:15] romulostx: that place where i even stop breathing to avoid minor movements that could make me fall Kappa
[1:17:15] Nimzo9: I got scared there :(
[1:23:05] Nimzo9: Harp, please.
[1:24:11] romulostx: i live to see harp tas strats in the future
[1:31:55] Nimzo9: Still alive.
[1:40:00] Nimzo9: 1 bomb for lanayru 2 right?
[1:41:16] romulostx: huh
[1:42:00] romulostx: you need 1 to break the boulder in skipper's retreat and after that i think you get more in pirates fortress
[1:44:38] romulostx: but tbh you can go there with 0 since you go through caves
[1:58:10] romulostx: gtg gl :>
[2:00:30] Nimzo9: THanks man.
[4:58:40] romulostx: NOOOOO
[4:58:52] zayloox_: :*

[4:59:04] romulostx: that's so unfortunate
[5:00:04] zayloox_: still a crazy good pace for 1st completed run
[5:00:09] zayloox_: Especially on english
[5:00:30] romulostx: ^
[5:01:54] romulostx: dying at skykeep sucks because depending on what is left you have to go through so many unnecessary rooms
[5:06:03] Nimzo9: This skykeep :/
[5:07:16] romulostx: gl on horde
[5:08:27] zayloox_: Nice :)

[5:12:45] Nimzo9: gg
[5:12:54] Nimzo9: I'm somewhat happy with this run.
[5:13:03] Nimzo9: Still a bad run IMO.
[5:13:22] romulostx: if this was jp would have beaten my pb
[5:13:50] romulostx: did any major time loss happen between din's flame and skykeep?
[5:14:02] Nimzo9: Yeah.
[5:14:08] Nimzo9: Died at Escort.
[5:14:20] romulostx: lol
[5:14:27] romulostx: can easily sub me with english
[5:14:30] Nimzo9: And it was at the last part too lol.
