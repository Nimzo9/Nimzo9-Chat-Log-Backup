[0:24:27] Hyxost: monkaS
[0:26:19] Nimzo9: if i just pause randomly like that it's becasue of the screen blackout

[0:33:05] PolarLike: ch0mskYlurk
[0:33:47] Nimzo9: nimzo9QQ
[0:39:51] Saria_100: wtf is this ship climbing bullshit I see on my screen
[0:46:32] Nimzo9: storing a chest cs changes links collission to be really tiny
[0:46:46] Nimzo9: and it lets you climb that ship like that
[0:55:56] bewildebeest: gl9 nimzo9
[0:56:14] Nimzo9: thanks mr beest
[0:56:48] bewildebeest: silver632Hmmm this doesn't seem ideal
[0:57:03] bewildebeest: ah
[0:57:12] Hyxost: beest :>
[0:57:34] bewildebeest: hyxost demPants
[0:58:11] Hyxost: demFesCat
[1:03:05] Nimzo9: okay I'm really happy I didn't die on any of the superswims
[1:03:31] bewildebeest: That is a good feeling
[1:16:50] Hyxost: PogChamp
[1:19:20] Hyxost: btw very small optimisation, right before you enter ganon's tower, there's like a tiny jump, it's better to hold neutral so link just drops to the floor and you can start rolling earlier, saves like 1 frame or something lol
[1:21:16] Nimzo9: oh really
[1:21:18] Nimzo9: ill have3 to chec kit
[1:21:58] Nimzo9: check it out
[1:22:55] Saria_100: dang
[1:23:57] Hyxost: tbf I think most runners now don't know this, maybe demon does it in the wr
[1:24:05] Hyxost: it's pretty obscure lol
[1:24:19] Nimzo9: is it that one edge just before the entrance?
[1:24:30] Hyxost: ye
[1:24:37] Nimzo9: im trying to think about what you're talking about
[1:24:43] Hyxost: just roll and release stick right before the ledge
[1:24:54] Hyxost: so link drops instead of jumps
[1:24:59] Nimzo9: makes sense
[1:36:15] EJ125: pog
[1:40:35] Hyxost: lol
[1:40:39] Hyxost: monkaS
[1:41:20] Nimzo9: 1 heart time
[1:44:47] Hyxost: noooo what
