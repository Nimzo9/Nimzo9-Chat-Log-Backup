[1:10:20] Nimzo9: I'm going to lose a lot of time
[1:12:45] keitsu23: perfect!
[1:22:09] white_thunder_14: This glitch is so weird
[1:57:31] Gigopler: gl
[1:58:41] Nimzo9: ty
[2:16:45] Nimzo9: might have just lost about a minute
[2:44:52] Floha258: Yo gl
[2:45:20] Nimzo9: thanks
[2:52:32] Kejsmaster: gl my man
[2:52:42] Nimzo9: thanks
[2:55:50] Floha258: I still don't know how i can get a halfway decent time xD
[2:57:51] rodner: gl on good game
[2:58:49] Nimzo9: ty
[3:02:31] pup_skipp: Question: why do you keep purposely only having two hearts?
[3:03:05] Floha258: Cause you need to bit warp constantly
[3:03:06] rodner: deathwarps
[3:03:10] rodner: stuffs
[3:03:18] Nimzo9: deathwarp here
[3:26:55] Nimzo9: This fire sanctuary is going to be really risky
[3:59:39] NowGamer: wassup
[3:59:53] pup_skipp: Dumb question: but what is a bit warp and what is a death warp?
[4:00:08] pup_skipp: I've played this game back in 2011 but only casually.
[4:00:32] rodner: death warp is dying and being put where you last interacted with an owl statue i think
[4:00:35] NowGamer: death warp is simply respawning, bit warp is saving and loading a file in a way to change your cordinates
[4:02:00] NowGamer: wait what
[4:02:26] NowGamer: bad luck mate
[4:05:21] Nimzo9: hmm, not sure how much time loss that was but it'll be a good chunk
[4:05:21] NowGamer: my god that was fast fight
[4:05:32] Nimzo9: also I'm forgetting splits lol
[4:05:54] NowGamer: what happened to your old splits?
[4:06:03] NowGamer: or rather why are they not showing
[4:07:28] Nimzo9: i deleted them
[4:16:20] NowGamer: never thought that you should just use that bomb instead of your own
[4:16:38] Nimzo9: I'm curious where this is compared to record.
[4:16:51] NowGamer: can try to find out if ya want
[4:17:25] Nimzo9: if you can, thanks
[4:18:17] NowGamer: he selects the statue at 07_09
[4:18:35] NowGamer: so about 33 seconds behind
[4:19:42] Nimzo9: this might still be sub 5 possible
[4:20:16] NowGamer: very possible
[4:21:13] NowGamer: gymnast tadtones were 20 sec slower than his old time, so if you can get perfect tadtones you could possible be tied with him
[4:21:35] Nimzo9: yeah
[4:22:28] Nimzo9: his end game is strong so I don't think wr is realistic
[4:23:17] NowGamer: ur like exactly 49 seconds behind him, but this is very possibly a second place run
[4:28:52] NowGamer: 4:17:50
[4:29:05] NowGamer: is his split, so ya only 2 s behind him
[4:29:11] NowGamer: 20*
[4:29:37] Nimzo9: That would mean 50 seconds
[4:30:38] NowGamer: his last not was the split, ur last note was 18:10 or so
[4:30:38] Nimzo9: I had really bad mistakes in the beginning and right before bilo
[4:30:51] NowGamer: when the song is played back that is
[4:35:59] TheOOT: good luck!
[4:39:59] Nimzo9: ty\
[4:46:55] NowGamer: ur legit only 22 seconds behind, so some perfect splits will be sub 5
[4:50:03] NowGamer: dude ur 6 seconds behind, this is so legit
[4:54:02] tlozsr: gl man
[4:54:56] Nimzo9: ty
[5:04:19] Nimzo9: this will barely be sub 5 if nothing goes wrong
[5:04:27] tlozsr: you got this
[5:04:30] romulostx: dope
[5:04:31] NowGamer: you are tied with him on the second nimzo
[5:05:02] Phio: gl
[5:05:30] GreenUprooter: This is insane
[5:05:33] mathsthew: it's yours man
[5:06:22] romulostx: woo
[5:06:24] tlozsr: nice!
[5:06:27] Phio: PogChamp

[5:07:15] WindMask: VoHiYo
[5:07:34] tlozsr: :O

[5:08:06] WindMask: What an epic duel between two master swordsman Kappa
[5:09:13] romulostx: gogogogogo
