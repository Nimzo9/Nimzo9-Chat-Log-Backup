[1:00:52] Zelkys: and has a pandulum made of her own hair
[1:00:54] Zelkys: MingLee
[1:03:00] Zelkys: nimzo
[1:03:05] Zelkys: you have a nice stream
[1:03:08] Zelkys: what's ur bitrate?
[1:03:34] Nimzo9: I think 1000
[1:03:36] Zelkys: when you have some time , can you do a screenshot of your settings please
[1:03:38] Zelkys: o ok
[1:03:45] Zelkys: well rip for me then
[1:03:46] Zelkys: XD
[1:03:49] Zelkys: i have 0.6 up
[1:04:08] Zelkys: still can do 480p (but less clean than ur 450)
[1:04:16] Zelkys: ty then :^)
[1:13:00] Nimzo9: I think all of my settings are close to default
[1:17:17] Zelkys: i think you could do 720p easily
[1:17:32] Zelkys: and use a better encoding like fast or medium
[1:17:34] Zelkys: :p
[1:17:42] Zelkys: but it's really nice like that
[1:18:32] Nimzo9: I'm not sure about 720
[1:18:41] Zelkys: what's your upload?
[1:18:44] Zelkys: 2 mo?
[1:18:51] Zelkys: mb*
[1:19:47] Nimzo9: I'm fine with my stream currently I think
[1:19:56] Nimzo9: it's 12 - 14 i think
[1:20:35] Nimzo9: my computer that's the main problem
[1:21:19] Zelkys: holy shit
[1:21:24] Zelkys: nice upload
[1:21:27] Zelkys: idk ur spec
[1:21:50] Zelkys: but yeah the computer can be a problem
[1:22:03] Zelkys: i think with 12-14 mb
[1:22:10] Zelkys: you can do online games at 1080p
[1:22:17] Zelkys: with very low ping
[1:23:29] Nimzo9: For some reason my ping is still kinda high
[1:23:39] Nimzo9: I remember when I played league it was at 60 or so
[1:23:50] Zelkys: lol
[1:23:57] Zelkys: which lane/rank/main

[3:12:21] Nimzo9: thanks :)

[3:25:40] Nimzo9: ty :)
[3:25:58] Harmjan387: how much ss any% japanese have you done in total?
[3:26:02] Harmjan387: runs
[3:26:12] Nimzo9: 186 it seems
[3:26:25] Harmjan387: damn
[3:27:07] Harmjan387: how did you feel when you found out you where 1 second of world record?
[3:27:30] Nimzo9: I didn't feel too bad lol
[3:27:53] Harmjan387: so close to wr is nice i makes it look get able
[3:28:28] Harmjan387: ig*
[3:28:35] Harmjan387: it*
[3:29:23] Nimzo9: my goal is 4:57 so It doesn't make a difference if it's wr or not
[3:29:31] Harmjan387: oke
[3:29:54] Nimzo9: i would have still done attempts
[3:30:06] gymnast86: yeah 4:57 would be a really good time
[3:30:45] Harmjan387: i agree gymnast and lets when you dont have wr anymore
[3:30:54] Harmjan387: lets see**
[3:33:38] Harmjan387: a lot of gold splits nice
[3:33:43] gymnast86: auto target WutFace
[3:38:15] Nimzo9: Most of those are fake golds because I deleted my splits
[3:38:29] Nimzo9: The only splits I had were from last run so any time I gain time it'll be a gold
[3:40:26] Harmjan387: i am leave going to watch a 24h stream of a friend of mine or i mean continue
[3:43:14] Nimzo9: I might be bedind, I'm unsure
[3:44:06] gymnast86: I usually just press A for the second shot
[3:44:29] Nimzo9: For some reason it's always inaccurate for me when I use a
[3:44:57] gymnast86: well yeah the spread range is way larger, but i'm usually able to consistently hit the eye with it
[3:45:09] gymnast86: I think I only ever missed it with A like once or twice
[3:49:08] Nimzo9: hmm, I'll probably try it that way then
[3:59:38] gymnast86: good luck with the rest of the run, make sure to PB by at least 2 seconds
[4:00:32] Nimzo9: Yeah, I'll try me best, thanks :)
[4:22:11] Zelkys: nice golds
[4:22:32] Zelkys: you'll eventually be ahead asap i think :)
[4:43:26] HalfJaise: How long have you been running this game approx?
[4:47:09] Nimzo9: I started doing runs like mid 2016 I think

[4:51:14] romulostx: what's the worst part of the run for you?
[4:52:09] Nimzo9: Uh
[4:52:17] Nimzo9: I don't really have a really bad part
[4:52:30] Nimzo9: This games pretty consistent overall
