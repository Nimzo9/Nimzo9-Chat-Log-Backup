[1:11:36] HalfJaise: gl
[1:12:14] Nimzo9: ty
[1:18:49] Kitcot6: Hey Nimzo! GL on the Run!
[1:19:05] Kitcot6: p.s. Congrats for WR a couple days back!
[1:20:13] Nimzo9: thanks
[1:21:45] Zelkys: back but gonna lurk
[1:21:47] Zelkys: gl man :)
[1:23:25] Nimzo9: alright, thanks
[1:26:10] Kitcot6: what do you think the time will be when this category is dead (if it ever is)?
[1:27:15] Nimzo9: probably 4:54 - 4:55?
[1:27:20] Nimzo9: idk
[1:31:13] Kitcot6: i would say 4:53 if not slower
[1:31:17] Zelkys: you'll get it one day :D
[1:31:19] Zelkys: i'm sure :D
[1:31:39] Kitcot6: I will not
[1:32:12] Kitcot6: my PB is 6:43:05 (PAL) so once I would get into the top tier of runners it would probably be too late :(
[1:32:20] HalfJaise: imma try and get a 5:05 and see if I want to push it from there
[1:32:32] HalfJaise: sub 5 would be a nice goal though
[1:32:46] Nimzo9: 4:55 would be like the god time imo
[1:32:56] HalfJaise: ^
[1:33:07] Kitcot6: yup
[1:33:08] Zelkys: it's never late @Kitcot
[1:33:11] Zelkys: just practice
[1:33:14] Zelkys: :)
[1:37:27] Harmjan387: i like your runs
[1:38:09] Nimzo9: why thank you
[1:39:13] Harmjan387: because your runs are fast
[1:58:41] Nimzo9: slow 2 cycle
[2:33:59] Harmjan387: playing with bombs
[2:34:02] Kitcot6: all the innovative ways on how to blow yourself up xD
[2:34:15] Emeralds77: blow yourself XD
[2:34:19] HalfJaise: xd
[2:34:34] Emeralds77: omg enddddder
[2:35:11] Kitcot6: now time for the worst part of the game! YAY! (not)
[2:46:10] Velatoget: this? I love this stuff
[2:46:25] Velatoget: this, imo, is what makes speedrunning awesome :)
[2:46:44] Emeralds77: what do you mean
[2:48:40] Velatoget: that trick where you run around with the file select menu open
[2:48:56] Velatoget: I love those types of tricks
[2:49:45] Nimzo9: yeah, BiT is cool
[2:50:02] Velatoget: ah yeah, Back in Time
[3:02:06] zayloox_: gl :>

[3:27:45] Venick: glglgl
[3:28:51] Nimzo9: tytyty
[3:47:25] Zelkys: nice run atm
[3:47:46] Zelkys: tho a bit rollercoaster, but ur ahead
[3:47:51] Zelkys: nice :^)
[3:49:37] Nimzo9: some time save coming this split too probably
[3:49:59] Zelkys: ayyy :D
[3:51:55] Emeralds77: nice harp
[3:57:00] Nimzo9: Yeah, we'll save a bit of time here
[4:01:17] Harmjan387: i am going to bed i will see if you pb tomorrow
[4:02:42] Nimzo9: Yeah, we'll see, take care.
[4:18:18] Hakua: gl
[4:19:22] Nimzo9: thanks :)
[4:19:30] Hakua: :)
[4:30:42] Nimzo9: wow, ghirahims nice today
[4:30:47] Emeralds77: that was fast
[4:31:26] Hakua: wow
[4:33:03] Zelkys: back
[4:33:07] Zelkys: holy shit nice run man :D
[4:33:20] Zelkys: will you skip 4:57? :p
[4:35:29] indykenobi: nice imp 2
[4:36:59] Zelkys: Kreygasm
[4:37:00] romulostx: wtf dude
[4:37:08] Zelkys: ?
[4:37:08] romulostx: obey the speed limit if you will
[4:37:14] Zelkys: lmao
[4:40:53] Zelkys: „ÅÑ
[4:44:19] romulostx: 69
[4:44:28] miss_input: nice
[4:52:54] Venick: GL on slingshot skip
[5:00:02] Velatoget: unfortunate there's no way to speed that little vehicle up :P
[5:01:41] Nimzo9: wait, how is that + but still gld?
[5:02:00] indykenobi: missing bilocyte split might be messing things up
[5:02:08] Hakua: probably because before it was combined with bilocyte
[5:04:20] Nimzo9: that makes sense
[5:05:37] Nimzo9: This split had perfect tadtones so I'll probably lose a bit of time here.
